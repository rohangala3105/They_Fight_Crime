First_script_They Fight Crime NLP.py : This script will scrape all the files from Canvas and created a merged file with all the characters.
Note : Change the download path for your system, which can be done in line 11 of First_script_They Fight Crime NLP.py. Make sure that you set the path as the path of the current folder. This helps as you won't have to change anything in the Second & Thrid Script.


Second Script : This script will clean the data by removing he's/she's from the beginning and run the sentiment analysis on the characters. After doing so it will store two dataframes of the male and female characters along with their polarities.
It also prints out the most positive and most negative statements for male and female.


Third Script : This Script joins all the characters and prints the top 10 most frequently used characters from "They Fight Crime!".

All the output will be printed on the output console of your IDE.
